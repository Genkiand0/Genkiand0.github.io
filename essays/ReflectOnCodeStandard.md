## What is the Coding Standards and Why are those Important?
At the beginning, I would like to clarify the definition of coding standards to reflect it. Coding standards are the rules and guidelines that define how code should be written, structured, and formatted. It may be different depending on the project and organization. The main benefit of coding standards is readability for others, including author-self. It improves the efficiency of teamwork and prevents the occurrence of errors because of its readability.

## Coding Standards are Grammars
Taking the above benefits into consideration, I believe that coding standards should be implemented, especially, when coding involves two or more people, coding standards must be used. In my opinion, code is similar to a spoken language, when doing group work using a programming language. I believe that one of the reasons is that it is called a programming “language,” but it is not only to communicate to the computer – we communicate with programmers using programming languages. 

As it’s called programming languages, I believe it should have a grammar like spoken languages. For example, It's possible to derive the meaning just from the words, even if the grammar is a complete mess, and the computer does this when reading a no-coding standard code. However, if the recipient is a person, unclear or non-grammatical writing may result in your intention not being fully conveyed and could lead to misunderstandings. 

Therefore, as same as spoken languages, programming languages should have rules to write like the grammar, and that is “coding standards.”

## Coding Standards and Learning Programming Languages:

It can be applied to learning a programming language. In my experience, I have had a ton of errors when writing code regarding unsure contents to learn it, and most errors were caused by a careless or simple mistake such as missing blacket. However, I could quickly find the point of error because I followed coding standards. Specifically, coding standards are easier to spot when something is out of place since the structure of the code is somewhat standardized even if I am not sure about it. Considering that it shortens the painful time spent on fixing errors, I believe its impact on sustaining motivation and concentration for learning is immeasurable.

## Impression of ESLint

Using ESLint means following ESLint’s coding standard, so people who use ESLint may be familiar with reading and understanding my code. The impression of ESLint is good that suggests the point of formatting errors with solutions in real time. I used to use the JUnit test when I was using JGrasp, but it didn’t respond to the error in real time. Thus, I have to do a test, check errors, return to the code with errors, and fix it, and I feel it was inconvenient to use. Indeed, it is annoying sometimes because it suggests too much even though the code isn’t completed, but it works as a reminder of what I need to add when writing a code.
