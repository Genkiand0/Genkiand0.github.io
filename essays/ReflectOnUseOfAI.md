## I. Introduction

	At present, Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly one of the biggest sources of concern for teachers since every class instruction mentions prohibitions and precautions about AI usage. Some instructor who is in the class I take this semester changed all homeworks to be optional to avoid students turning it in with all AI provided answers.

	Following this, I believe AI should serve as a tool to support learning in education because the main purpose of learning is obviously to acquire knowledge of or skill in. Since we want to acquire knowledge and skills, AI should not disturb it, in other words, just using AI to solve all assignments is incorrect usage for learning. Through this course, I have been careful to use AI cautiously and appropriately when I use ChatGPT and Copilot.

## II. Personal Experiences with AI

- Experience WODs e.g. E18
	- I use an AI extension to shorten the time spent for the repetition. 
- In-class Practice WODs
	- Almost the same as above. Because screencasts use the AI extension, I felt that it was a waste of time if I didn't.
- In-class WODs
	- Almost the same as above. I used AI if I completely stack on some error Essays
	- I used AI as a translator when I got the idea in my first language.
- Final project
	- I use an AI extension for this to shortcut such as the importing files to a page.
- Learning a concept / tutorial
	- If I stuck on the error with unknown cause I asked it AI by pasting error code.
- Answering a question in class or in Discord
	- I didn’t have an opportunity to answer some questions on the Discord server.
- Asking or answering a smart-question
- Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
	- I asked for giving the example to implement Google Map in our app in the final project
- Explaining code
	- I did this using the AI extension, it was helpful to understand the template-nextjs
- Writing code
	- Usually not, I only use this for the suggestion of the code which I understand the function.
- Documenting code
- Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code \<code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in \<code here>”
 	- I did use AI to follow the Code Standards of ESLint
- Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
	- I didn’t use AI in other situations.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

	At the beginning of this course, I considered that using AI to do WODs including practice one, may interfere with learning by automatically helping too much if I use the Copilot extension in VS Code, so I did not use it for the first few WODs. When using AI, I make sure that I am not misunderstanding the instructions and limit myself to basic information, such as CSS formatting.
 
	However, I started using the Copilot extension about the middle of the semester because it began to be used frequently in the instruction screencast. The impression of the AI extension is that it does not provide too much help for the WODs — it just provides code for reputational code in the different file and skip implementation for initialization at the top. Those help was really useful and I could significantly reduce coding time in WODs, especially handling many files. As a result, the AI extension is not harmful for learning and, on the contrary, has a positive effect on making code with many files. At the same time, I don’t think I should use the extension for the first few WODs in VS Code because it was regarding foundational coding which AI suggests frequently, so if I use it I may lose an opportunity to learn about the foundational coding by just pressing tab to put AI suggested code.
 
	The other role of AI in this course was the translator. As a non-native English speaker, using AI as a translator was innovative because it provided flexible situational answers unlike the web translator. For example, when I want a formal sentence for the essay, I cannot know if the translated sentence is polite and in the formal tense by using a non-AI translator, but I can order “provide a formal and academic sentence” for AI. I am often concerned about checking if my writing is correct or following the academic rules, and only using the non-AI translator does not provide subtle nuances of a sentence. 
 
	An additional benefit of using AI as a translator is to provide different examples of the sentence from one base sentence in Japanese. Those benefits must enhance and help so much for essay writing for me. On the other hand, the dangerousness of writing an essay with AI is leaving everything to AI including the idea of the essay. To be honest, I wasn’t particularly worried about this case because I love thinking about a certain topic and sharing my ideas of the topic — in short, I like writing essays! Therefore, I won’t leave a thinking part to AI for my pleasure.

## IV.  Practical Applications:

	For Practical Applications, the extension is one of the most used AI in this course and it is used by many programmers using VS Code. It will help us by omitting repetition and suggesting a complete code on partially written code, then speed up the development. Also, AI is used to check errors and detect potential bugs. I believe that using AI to monitor coders can reduce mistakes, avoid confusion, and identify security vulnerabilities.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities:

	One certain coherent limitation for using AI is that I do not want to use AI if I don’t understand or know about AI suggestions. If I use AI to gain new knowledge, I must check other sources as well, so I’m dealing with AI suggestions with one opinion of someone who I don't know well. When using AI, it is important to assess the efficiency of studying and whether it hinders learning. To achieve this, we should stop demanding direct answers to issues and challenges.

## VI. Comparative Analysis:

	Overall the evaluation and thoughts on AI as a student. For me, AI feels like a handy friend who can answer any question, so they give the wrong answer sometimes, in other words, an extremely flexible and relatively accurate internet search. Like humans, it does not always give accurate answers, but it does provide answers.As I mentioned at the beginning, AI should support the learning process. In a specific example, imagine you have a really smart friend who seems to know everything, and you want to learn something, then you may not ask only the answer or not leave all your assignment to the person if you want to practice it. I believe this is the same situation to use AI, so you should limit yourself to asking questions and seeking hints, as the teacher does, in order to make effective use of AI.

## VII. Future Considerations:

	When I search for some errors in Google, the first thing showing up on the page is an AI generated answer — AI is already an inseparable relation with us. Furthermore, as was the case with WOD screencast, it is expected that coding skills in software engineering based on AI will be required in the future. That is why we should consider more efficient study methods and uses that were not possible before the spread of AI, and use AI efficiently. For example, one advantage of AI is that you can ask questions at any time, so you can resolve doubts and confusion without wasting time waiting for a reply to an email, as you would when asking a professor a question. As long as you don't misuse it by simply getting the answers, this can be considered a major advantage.

## VIII. Conclusion:

	In conclusion, AI in education should be approached as a supportive tool and enhance learning — not use as an answer giving machine. My experience throughout this course shows that, when used AI thoughtfully, it can enhance efficiency, reduce repetitive work, and provide valuable learning assistance without undermining the learning process. The key is to maintain personal engagement in problem-solving and think critically, so I should use AI only as a guide or clarify my thoughts. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into both academic and professional environments, rather than rejecting AI, it is important to use it correctly, so it will be necessary to learn how to use it properly in software engineering and beyond.
