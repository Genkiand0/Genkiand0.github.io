## My Impression for using UI frameworks
To get straight to the point, using UI frameworks were honestly difficult for me. In fact, when I created a navbar in the E36 "Your Choice with Bootstrap 5" assignment, I tried making one using Bootstrap 5 and another using just HTML and CSS — and I felt the latter to be easier. However, I think it is because I am not familiar with Bootstrap yet, and HTML and CSS as well. Specifically, I haven’t felt inconvenience using HTML and CSS since I’ve only recently started using HTML and CSS, so I couldn’t feel improvements by using UI frameworks. 


## Benefits
One of the benefits using UI frameworks is, similar to Code Standards, consistency. It makes the webpage look consistent and, for a programmer, it may prevent making mistakes structuring and designing the webpage. For example, it can help minimize layout shifts or misalignment which might be caused by spacing different objects such as columns. Also, the consistent webpage improves ease of understanding to a viewer of the page.

Another benefit I noticed is the reduction in the amount of writing style in CSS required. When I did  E36 "Your Choice with Bootstrap 5", the index.html file became quite complicated because I wrote a lot using style for my webpage — there were so many id and classes. However, in the assignment of making the Island Snow webpage, the instructions use quite a few CSS. If I could use Bootstrap more efficiently, my index file of the webpage would be more simple.


## Conclusion and how I can be familiar with UI frameworks
In conclusion, benefits of using UI frameworks certainly exist, but there are still many aspects I find difficult because I’m not yet used to UI frameworks. However, I believe that once I become familiar with them, I’ll be able to skip certain steps and write cleaner, more understandable code. To achieve that, I think it's important to practice by creating several web pages using Bootstrap.
