My first encounter with programming was 10 years old when I participated in the experience event of the Line Follower Robots held in a university in Japan. In the event, participants make robots and program using the block coding software to trace a line printed on the floor. After that, I became interested in programming and engineering robots, and I entered middle high school which has a programming course. 

However, I did not do much coding when I was a high school student because I was worried about my future, such as a job. Eventually, I had lost sight of my interests, but when I entered Kapiolani Community College, I was able to reaffirm my interests through taking a class at KCC. 

Then, I decided to major in Computer Science to study software engineering, video game engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. For software engineering, I am interested in how to develop software and deepen my understanding of software.

## 1. Developing software.
Previously, I had learned about basic coding and done several projects using basic skills through the ICS classes, however, I feel developing software is the application of basic skills. As for the application, I need to use what we’ve learned in previous classes as tools for this class. Since software engineering is not only coding, I must think and learn its design, performance, improving security, etc to understand software engineering. 

Therefore, learning software engineering is a whole new challenge for me, and I am really excited to learn software engineering.

## 2. Knowing about software
Besides learning engineering, understanding software is also important which I am interested in. For example, I need to know what is good software and secure software if I consider publishing my own software because knowing good software is necessary to analyze and improve my software. 

In everyday life, I use a lot of software, however, I don’t actually know how it was developed and designed, so I want to learn about software, deepen my knowledge of software engineering, and use it for my future career.
## Conclution
In conclusion, I am looking forward to learning about software engineering and understanding what software is. This class is the beginning of learning software engineering for me, so the knowledge I will learn in this course would be my foundation of developing software. 

Thus, I keep in mind that there are no misunderstandings, and if I find mistakes, do not leave and solve it by asking the teacher, discussing with friends, and searching on the internet. More than that, I want to enjoy learning about software engineering and acquire my new skills.
