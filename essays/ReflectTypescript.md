**Amazing!** That is my first impression of Typescript and playground because I am a complete newbie of Typescript. Specifically, I learned Java, C, and C++ in the previous ICS class, and I used JGrasp and VIM and EMACS of Windows PowerShell as an environment and compiler. Compared to those, Typescript is intuitive, easy to understand, and I immediately understood what it represented from the code when I saw a code of the object. 

I experienced a similar feeling the first time I used C, previously using Java, but this time I feel more comfortable and it was groundbreaking for me. For example, I can use “const” and “let” interchangeably for value which means I do not need to strictly pay attention to value compared to using int, double, char, etc. Also, I can state the value for a specific type using a notation if I want to. For ES6 I couldn’t believe it at first because I didn’t think the function statement would be really short.

Even though I haven’t felt a strength for software engineering yet, I think Typescript is a good programming language since it is really intuitive.

# WODs is Nice!
About WODs, it is a really effective way to learn programming that at least really works for me because I am often absorbed in writing and trying to solve some problems and forget a time, otherwise completely less concentration. In math class, I stacked on one problem of homework for an hour and a half without noticing the time passage. 

I usually try to control myself by taking a coffee break etc, and I felt WODs helped for it. WODs give me a break if I stack on the problem and also give me certain concentration times. Additionally, it improves fast writing skills for programming because the usual assignment of coding is no need to write faster, but WODs encourages me to write faster. 

It is great way to practice fastness and accuracy of writing code.
