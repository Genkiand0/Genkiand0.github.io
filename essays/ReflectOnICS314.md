## Introduction

At this point, with only about a week left in ICS314 class, the pressure of the final exam, the last assignments, and the completion of projects makes me keenly feel the semester is going to end. Over the course of this short semester, I faced various difficulties, challenges, and unfamiliar errors that gave me quite a headache, but I also learned a great deal from them — I was able to enjoy those experiences and learning.

Among them, learning about the User Interface Framework, which is a collection of web development tools and templates, especially, React-Bootstrap was particularly interesting. It’s because, before taking this course, I was a complete beginner in website development, with only a faint knowledge of HTML, so it was my first time learning that Open Source Framework like React are widely used in developing websites.

Outside of the coding aspects, Agile Project Management and Ethics in Software Engineering provided me with challenges and valuable learning experiences that greatly stimulated my growth in web development.

## I. HTML and CSS Are Not Enough! --- User Interface Framework

At the beginning of the class, we started learning about TypeScript, but I often wondered why we needed to practice coding using so many functions because I believed people only use HTML and CSS to develop web applications — I misunderstood as CSS does control the functionally parts of the website at the time. Finally, I used a lot of functions in the final project development, then I understood that was really important practice. Beside TypeScript functions, learning and using UI Framework was completely new knowledge for me. Hence, when I started using React, understanding it and getting familiar with it was not easy. 

Especially, The digits assignments which are making a web application with React-Bootstrap and Next.js is a tough challenge. One of the difficulties of those assignments is the problem with the schedule. I was confused by the conflicting schedules on two websites, and mistakenly started working on the Digits assignment before the main Next.js template assignment, so I started an application assignment skipping the basic tutorial. I definitely spent more time on it than on other assignments, and ended up submitting it just before the deadline although I was late on a few due to misunderstandings about the deadlines… 

However, I view this situation positively because spending a lot of time on the assignment, thinking deeply, and trying to understand it ultimately allowed me to gain a deeper understanding. The tutorial assignments that I had postponed ended up mistakenly serving as valuable reviews and reinforcement after I understood the material, as a result it was a beneficial learning experience. Based on the experience, I feel it was very beneficial that I could deepen my understanding of React and Next.js before starting development on the final project.

## II. The Future Challenge --- Agile Project Manegiment

Project Management was the area where I made the most mistakes, and it represents my greatest challenge going forward. I’ve found that I struggle with scheduling and collaborative work involiving multiple people, primarily because it’s difficult for me to develop at my own pace in such situations. Specifically, working in a group with familiar teammates is fine, but collaborating with people I’ve just met presents unique challenges unlike developing alone. It’s difficult to gauge how much work each person can handle, and I may need to follow up on delays caused by team members. These aspects introduce complexities that are quite different from solo development. 

However, group work is an unavoidable part of software engineering and development, and it is true that collaboration enables us to accomplish goals that would be impossible alone. Therefore, I need to become more comfortable with team-based development using GitHub, and this is the biggest challenge I face in this class.

## III. The Most Interesting and Meaningful --- Ethic in Software Engineering

The most interesting topic through this course is that I was able to deeply reflect on the Ethics in Software Engineering such as, development rules and the role of AI in software engineering. Originally, I enjoy establishing my own rules or answers for something and sharing them, so writing a reflective essay gave me an opportunity to think well about the topic and deepen my understanding, which I found very interesting. From essays about Coding Standard and Using Frameworks, I learned how consistency in code is crucial in software development and how those help reduce errors and facilitate smoother communication in group work. 

In deriving my thought to write technical essays, thinking about the role of AI in software engineering was really valuable and encouraged me to know how I should use AI correctly. I recognized that AI has the potential to hinder learning by taking away opportunities of challenges or difficulties and thus undermine the learning process. However, from a software engineering perspective, I also saw that there are efficient ways to use AI for learning that were not possible before AI spread because, in the software engineering field, AI is utilized more effectively compared to general uses. 

For example, working on relatively large projects involving many files and complex interdependencies, there are numerous repetitive tasks such as creating importation statements, wiring documentation, and explaining functions — that can be greatly simplified using AI. In addition, AI helps identify errors and provides solutions, making it easier to maintain stable development, and those will accelerate software development. 

The differences between software engineering and learning it is the key lies in whether the focus is placed on the outcome or the process. AI is an extremely powerful tool when it comes to the outcome less regarding process, but its use becomes more critical in the process. Being mindful of this difference, I want to strive to use AI effectively in learning as well.

## Summarize The Experience

In summary, I believe that through this course, I have acquired many skills, learned to think from a software engineering perspective, and clarified my future challenges, which has allowed me to grow significantly. Due to the fact that, I regret losing some learning opportunities due to scheduling issues caused by the new system. Nevertheless, despite facing difficulties and challenges, I believe I did my best, and I hope to use what I’ve learned here as a foundation for my future.
