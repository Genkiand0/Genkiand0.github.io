## “It was broken without doing anything. What can I do?”

“It was broken without doing anything. What can I do?” This statement is a very famous phrase in computer science in Japan as a stupid question. This phrase is often said by people who are using a computer for the first time or older individuals who aren't familiar with it when the result of an operation turns out to be different from what was expected. In most cases a computer almost never breaks on its own, thus, the answer of the question is “No, it was not broken without doing something.” 

This stupid question is caused by a complete lack of knowledge about computers, but it's extremely vague and lacking in explanation — and on top of that, "without doing anything" is a lie. Asking ridiculous questions like those mentioned is not how people who truly need answers should ask.  When we ask questions to solve a problem, we are seeking effective answers. Therefore, we have a responsibility to make it as easy as possible for responders to provide those effective answers. 

I felt that in order to obtain effective answers quickly and accurately, it is important not only to have knowledge about the field you are asking about but also to understand how to ask questions properly.

## A Smart Question

In Stack Overflow, I have found the question about Typescript asking about how to create Angular 5 File upload part. 

```
I'm a beginner with Angular, I want to know how to create Angular 5 File upload part, I'm trying to find any tutorial or doc, but I don't see anything anywhere. Any idea for this? And I tried ng4-files but it's not working for Angular 5
```

This simple question can be improved, but it captures the main point of asking. For example, the asker clearly shows what is a problem and shows the effort to find the answer by searching and trying to do the same for similar files. As a result, the asker got 17 answers and 399 votes, so many people have the same problem and discussed this question.

## A Stupid Question:

On the other hand, the bad question I found in Stack Overflow is about VIM.

```
I am stuck and cannot escape. It says:
type :quit<Enter> to quit VIM
But when I type that it simply appears in the object body.
```

This question is discussed by many people, but the answer can be found just searching for the Vim Command on the internet. Personally, I like this question because the asker said “cannot escape”, but the solution is to press “escape key” and do the same process. However, it is too simple to ask a professional on Stack Overflow.

## Conclusion

We ask questions and seek help from an unspecified number of people in order to get effective answers to our problems — not to post about our confusion or frustration on social media just to gain sympathy. Asking smart questions not only benefits the person answering but also provides an opportunity to analyze one's own problem, which can help in solving it.
