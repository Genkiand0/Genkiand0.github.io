## Sometimes, There Are Things More Important than Originality
In today’s world, originality is an essential element of creation and can be considered the very soul of a creator, regardless of the field. However, overemphasizing originality in the incorrect point, can become overkill. Sometimes, there is a more efficient way to create. I believe that the Design Patterns is one of those because it is a solution to common issues, created and refined by experienced developers. Trying to make everything from scratch on your own is perhaps good for learning how to make it, but it is quite inefficient! — it is sort of  “reinventing the wheel.”

In the software engineering field, to do that you first need to prepare every step of the process yourself, and when issues arise, you must come up with solutions on your own. However, each of these steps takes a significant amount of time, which often leads to undesirable outcomes — such as not being able to complete what you set out to build, or ending up with something different from what you originally envisioned. To avoid that, we can use the wisdom or template of our predecessors.

## Design Patterns are Strong Tools!
Like UI frameworks and Code Standards, Design Patterns provide consistency. It may prevent error structuring and designing, and it makes it easier to share design intentions during group work, which leads to smoother communication. If encounter a problem . Also it makes much easier to find the solution in the internet because there are many people who sharing the same design pattern in the same situation. 

The biggest advantage is that when you face a similar problem again, applying a pattern allows you to find a solution more efficiently. It’s like how your immune system responds faster and more effectively the second time you get sick. Following that analogy, using existing design patterns is like getting a vaccine — it prepares you in advance to deal with problems more efficiently.

## Using nextjs-application-template as A Design Pattern

At the first of using the template, I was a bit confused about the file structure, but, working on it through a different assignment, I was familiar with the template and much faster to construct code. Especially in programming, I felt that many problems are solved through pattern matching. However, at the same time, it becomes even more important to deepen one’s understanding of design patterns. 

## Conclusion
I believe that design patterns are essential when learning to code. They not only help us learn more efficiently but also make it easier to identify mistakes and pinpoint problems. By using of the design patterns, I want to aim to learn creating and developing more complex systems as I continue learning in this field.
