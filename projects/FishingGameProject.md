The Fishing Game Project was the final project of ICS 211 class, and it was done as a group of 3-4 people. The base setting of the game is a fishing competition in Hawaii that involves two players participating in a competition as fishermen.  Players take turns alternatively and they can try to catch a fish only one per a month. The game ran through one year(12 months), then they would compete for the size or number of fish caught to determine the winner after the last month. The uniqueness of this game is that, in Hawaii, there is a rule to catch the fish which a particular type of fish has an illegal size to catch. Thus, the player must think about the rule when they catch the fish during the game before keeping it. If players selected keep an illegal size of fishes, it will be punished such as losing all of the fish you caught.

The main purpose of developing this game is to practice and be familiar with Java. The fishes are the object with the inheritance, and it can grow up to the parents' class depending on its size. This feature reflects a Hawaiiian trait of changing names as the fish grows from fry. All fish are inherited from a class called “I’a” class which means fish in Hawaiian. There are 3-4 groups doing this project and we are all based on the I’a class and the fish inherited, but we can make an original part for other parts of the game such as the progression of the competition. Our group makes the players able to access the rules during the game. Specifically, the rule is written which fish and size is illegal or legal to catch to make our games easier to play because we felt that remembering all of the fishing rules is too hard. 

Additionally, I implemented an original reward for the winner which is the dish of caught fish during the game. I wrote a code to implement various delicious dishes depending on the fish the player catches. At first, I considered the dishes to be a dish object with inheritance just like a I’a class. However, I couldn’t make it: only the text-output depended on the fish because I spent too much time making other parts of the game and miscommunication with group mates. From this experience I learned the difficulty of working as a group for the same project and how to develop the text-based game.
