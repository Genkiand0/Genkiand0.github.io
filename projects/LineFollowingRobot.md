## Line Following Robot Project:
The Line Following Robot Project was what I did when I was in middle school. It was a sort of race in which the robot ran the circuit of the black line with a couple of silver squares on the white sheet. It was imitated by the space mission, and the robot had to complete tasks. The robot has color sensors on the left, right and center and decides the movement of detected color. For example, if the left and right sensors detect white, then go straight, or if the left or right sensor detects black turn the body to the side of the sensor detecting black. 

If the robot is programmed to do those movements and put the robot on the line,  it follows the black line without crossing the line. Also, if the robot detects silver, it must do particular movements such as stop for a 1 second and take a block that represents supplies. 

The most challenging point is that a part of the course was disconnected and isolated, and when a specific sensor detected silver, it had to leave the current course once and reach the next part of the course. I made a code to come back from a course when the robot went away from the line to reach a goal. 

There was a competition for the project. I was 8th place among the junior high school students from many places in Japan.  Looking back from the present, I feel there is still plenty of room for improvement, but by applying various creative ideas and approaching the task of building a robot that runs the course more efficiently and quickly from both hardware and coding perspectives, I was able to deepen my understanding of robot engineering.
